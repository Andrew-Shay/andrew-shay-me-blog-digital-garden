andrewshay.me Blog and Digital Garden Source and build script

build.py is licensed under MIT. Just remove my name and domain if you use it.
Code is awful, copy paste etc. Use at your own risk.

No third party dependencies so I have basic hand rolled markdown parsing.  
Only supports what I've needed so far.
