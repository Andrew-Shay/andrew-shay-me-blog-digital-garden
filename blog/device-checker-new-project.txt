title: Device Checker: New project for detecting changes on Windows
date:2018-03-24
tags:python,windows,software,device checker
body:
I recently wanted software to notify me when services, installed programs, and startup programs were added, removed, or changed.  
I found some wmic commands to give me that information, as well as much more information.  

I created a program to simply gather information about a Windows system and then notify the user when it has changed, and view the differences.  

It is currently released in beta.
