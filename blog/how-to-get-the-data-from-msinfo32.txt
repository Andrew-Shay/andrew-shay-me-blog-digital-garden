body:
I was recently looking to gather the same data that msinfo32 reports and I found a couple wmic commands that provided me with what I needed.  

The first is a basic wmic command eg `wmic service get /format:list`.  This will output the services on Windows.  
Run `wmic /?` to see a list of other information you can gather.  
Other formatting options `/format:table` and `/format:csv`  

The second wmic command uses the CIM WMI Provider.  eg `wmic path CIM_LogicialDisk get /value`.  This outputs the logical disks that Windows detects.  
To find a list of possible options see the MSDN docs [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa386541.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa386541.aspx)
