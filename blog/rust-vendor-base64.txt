## What is Vendor Base64
[rust_vendor_base64](https://github.com/Andrew-Shay/rust_vendor_base64) is my implementation of base64, in rust, that is meant to be vendored in rust projects.  
It is not available on crates.io to be installed.  

I created it because it's something so simple that I think it should be included in the rust stdlib.  
And when the [base64 crate](https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64) broke their API, I decided I should implement it and have a module that others could vendor without risking the API breaking.
